# RadialEvaporation

 The code is located in Evap_StandAlone directory.
 If you found this code helpful, please cite the following journal article.

 A. Pathak, M. Raessi, Steady-state and transient solutions to drop evaporation 
 in a finite domain: Alternative benchmarks to the d2 law, Int. J. Heat Mass Transfer (2018),
 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2018.06.071

 The details of the governing equations and numerical descritization are
 also given in the article.

 The test cases presented in the Journal article are also setup in the
 current code. Any new fluid or test case could be added by modifying
 the code. See the comment in the "main" file.

 The "main" file is trans_evap_cool_2D_3D.m. Make sure you add AdaptiveMesh, figstate, and SteamTable to the path of
 your Matlab. In case you are unable to do it, copy all the files in those
 directories to the current directory.

 This code has been tested on MATLAB (2017a) version. MATLAB is a
 recommended software to run this code. The free software Octave could
 also be used, however we found it to be slower.
